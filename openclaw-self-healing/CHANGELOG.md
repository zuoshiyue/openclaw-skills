## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Level 2→3 Chain Disconnection** — Watchdog now auto-escalates to Emergency Recovery after 30min of continuous failure (was completely disconnected)
- **Discord Webhook Never Set** — emergency-recovery-v2.sh now reads `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` from `~/.openclaw/.env` with graceful fallback if not configured
- **Installer Only Set Up Level 2** — Complete chain now installed out of the box

### Changed
- **gateway-watchdog.sh v4.1** — Added `check_level3_escalation()` and `trigger_level3_emergency_recovery()` functions; critical failure tracking with configurable 30min threshold
- **gateway-healthcheck.sh** — Fixed escalation path to emergency-recovery-v2.sh; improved .env loading
- **emergency-recovery-v2.sh** — Prioritized `~/.openclaw/.env` over `~/openclaw/.env`; logs when no webhooks configured instead of failing silently
- **install.sh** — Complete rewrite: sets up full 4-tier chain (Watchdog LaunchAgent with `StartInterval` only — no `KeepAlive`), interactive .env generation, auto-detects gateway token, verification step
- **install-linux.sh** — Complete rewrite: systemd-based setup with timer units, interactive configuration, verification
- **.env.example** — Added Watchdog configuration variables, gateway port/token, Level 3 escalation timing
- **README.md** — Updated architecture diagram to reflect actual Level 1→2→3→4 chain with accurate timing and trigger conditions

### Removed
- LaunchAgent `KeepAlive` + `StartInterval` conflict (2/7 incident lesson)

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Emergency PTY Recovery Auto-Trigger** — Level 3 now automatically triggers when Watchdog detects critical failures (crash >= 5 OR doctor --fix fails 2x)
- **config-watch Auto-Repair** — Proactive config validation with automatic `doctor --fix` on schema violations (~2min recovery)
- **Enhanced 4-Tier Self-Healing** — config-watch (L1) → Watchdog (L2) → Emergency PTY (L3) → Guardian + Discord (L4)

### Changed
- **Watchdog v5.4** — Now triggers Emergency Recovery instead of giving up on critical failures
- **config-watch** — Enhanced with JSON validation + auto-repair (previously backup-only)
- **Architecture** — Maintained 4-tier structure, added config-watch as new L1, Emergency PTY as L3

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: Emergency Recovery script existed but was never automatically triggered (fixed by adding Watchdog integration)
- **Recovery Gap**: No automatic escalation path from Watchdog to Claude autonomous recovery

### Performance
- **Config errors**: Now recover in ~2min (down from manual intervention)
- **Complex failures**: Auto-trigger Claude recovery (previously required manual script execution)

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with new 3-tier architecture diagram
- Added recovery path examples
- Updated "What Makes This Special" section with v2.1 features

### Technical Details
- `gateway-watchdog.sh`: Added Emergency Recovery trigger at 3 critical failure points
- `config-watch.sh`: Added `doctor --check` + `doctor --fix` auto-execution
- Both scripts now send Discord alerts on auto-repair success/failure

---

## [2.0.2] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Watchdog v5.3 - Auto Config Fix**: Automatic `openclaw doctor --fix` execution when crash_count >= 2
  - Detects configuration validation errors automatically
  - Reduces recovery time from 36 minutes to 7 minutes (5x faster)
  - No separate cron required (integrated into Watchdog LaunchAgent)
  - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Improved
- **Gateway Recovery**: Enhanced self-healing system with configuration auto-fix
- **Alerting**: Discord notifications now include auto-fix attempt information
- **Documentation**: Added detailed version history for Watchdog v5.3

### Technical Details
- **Trigger condition**: crash_count >= 2 (5+ minutes of continuous failure)
- **Action**: Execute `openclaw doctor --fix` to repair configuration errors
- **Fallback**: If auto-fix fails, continues with standard restart retry logic
- **Risk**: Minimal (code changes isolated, easy rollback via git revert)

## [2.0.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Reasoning log extraction:** Claude's reasoning process (Decision Making, Lessons Learned) is now properly extracted and appended to `recovery-learnings.md` (#Critical)
- **Version consistency:** Script header version unified to v2.0.0 across all files
- **Environment variable naming:** `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` consistency improved in `emergency-recovery-v2.sh`
- **ShellCheck warnings:** `read -r` flag added to `metrics-dashboard.sh` (SC2162)

### Improved
- **Edge case handling:** Graceful fallback when reasoning log file is missing
- **Code quality:** ShellCheck recommendations applied
