**Key files to understand first:**
1. `scripts/gateway-watchdog.sh` — The main loop that monitors everything
2. `scripts/emergency-recovery.sh` — How Claude AI gets invoked for diagnosis
3. `install.sh` — How the system gets deployed

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ramsbaby/openclaw-self-healing.git
cd openclaw-self-healing

# Install dependencies
brew install tmux shellcheck
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example ~/.openclaw/.env
```

### Code Style

**Bash scripts:**
- Use `shellcheck` for linting: `shellcheck scripts/*.sh`
- 2-space indentation
- Meaningful variable names (avoid `$a`, `$b`, etc.)
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Use functions for reusable code

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Good: Clear function name, descriptive variables
check_gateway_health() {
  local gateway_url="$1"
  local http_code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$gateway_url")
  
  if [ "$http_code" = "200" ]; then
    return 0
  else
    log "Gateway unhealthy: HTTP $http_code"
    return 1
  fi
}

# Bad: Cryptic, hard to understand
chk() {
  local u="$1"
  local c=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$u")
  [ "$c" = "200" ] && return 0 || return 1
}
```

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

### 1. Fork & Branch

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openclaw-self-healing.git
cd openclaw-self-healing

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

```bash
# Edit files
nano scripts/gateway-healthcheck.sh

# Run shellcheck
shellcheck scripts/*.sh

# Test manually
bash scripts/gateway-healthcheck.sh
```

### 3. Test Thoroughly

**Required tests before submitting PR:**

- [ ] **Level 1 (Watchdog):** Kill Gateway, verify auto-restart
- [ ] **Level 2 (Health Check):** Simulate failure, verify retries
- [ ] **Level 3 (Claude Recovery):** Inject config error, verify Claude diagnosis
- [ ] **Level 4 (Discord Alert):** Simulate Level 3 failure, verify notification

**Test checklist:**
```bash
# 1. Kill Gateway
kill -9 $(pgrep -f openclaw-gateway)
sleep 180
curl http://localhost:18789/
# Expected: HTTP 200

# 2. Stop Gateway manually
openclaw gateway stop
tail -f ~/openclaw/memory/healthcheck-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
# Expected: Restart attempts

# 3. Break config (backup first!)
cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak
# (edit to break Gateway)
# Wait 8 minutes, check Level 3 logs

# 4. Simulate Level 3 failure
# (see TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
bash ~/openclaw/scripts/emergency-recovery-monitor.sh
# Expected: Discord alert or console output
```

### 4. Commit & Push

```bash
# Stage changes
git add scripts/gateway-healthcheck.sh

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add configurable retry delay for Health Check

- Add HEALTH_CHECK_RETRY_DELAY environment variable
- Default 30s, configurable via .env
- Update documentation with new variable"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 📐 Coding Standards

### Bash Best Practices

1. **Always quote variables:**
   ```bash
   # Good
   if [ "$http_code" = "200" ]; then
   
   # Bad
   if [ $http_code = "200" ]; then
   ```

2. **Use meaningful names:**
   ```bash
   # Good
   RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=1800
   
   # Bad
   T=1800
   ```

3. **Check exit codes:**
   ```bash
   # Good
   if curl -X POST "$DISCORD_WEBHOOK" ... ; then
     log "Success"
   else
     log "Failed"
   fi
   
   # Bad
   curl -X POST "$DISCORD_WEBHOOK" ...
   ```

4. **Use functions:**
   ```bash
   # Good
   send_discord_notification() {
     local message="$1"
     # ... implementation
   }
   
   # Bad
   # Duplicate code multiple times
   ```

5. **Set exit trap for cleanup:**
   ```bash
   # Good
   trap "rm -f $LOCKFILE" EXIT
   
   # Bad
   # Forget to cleanup, leave stale locks
   ```

### Documentation Standards

1. **Update README.md** if adding/changing features
2. **Update QUICKSTART.md** if changing installation
3. **Update TROUBLESHOOTING.md** if fixing bugs
4. **Add inline comments** for complex logic

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (Manual)

```bash
# Test individual functions
bash -c '
source scripts/gateway-healthcheck.sh
check_http
echo "Exit code: $?"
'
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Test full workflow
# 1. Stop Gateway
# 2. Wait for Health Check trigger
# 3. Verify Level 2 recovery
# 4. If Level 3 needed, verify Claude session
# 5. Verify Discord notification
```

### Edge Case Tests

- **Network failure:** Disconnect wifi, verify graceful degradation
- **Disk full:** Fill disk, verify logs don't crash system
- **Claude quota exhausted:** Verify Level 3 → Level 4 escalation
- **Discord webhook invalid:** Verify fallback to console output
